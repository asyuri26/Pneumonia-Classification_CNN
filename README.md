# Pneumonia Classification using CNN

## Project Description
This project is a part of the Technical Test RnD, aiming to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: **Pneumonia** and **Normal**.

## Objectives
- Preprocess and normalize X-ray image data
- Build and train a CNN model for binary image classification
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss metrics

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, NumPy

## Model
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Techniques used: data augmentation, dropout, and normalization

## Final Results
The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between pneumonia and normal cases, with training and validation results available in the notebook.
